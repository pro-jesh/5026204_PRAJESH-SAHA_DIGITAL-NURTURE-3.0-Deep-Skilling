## Step 1:  Understand Search Algorithms
## 1.Linear Search:

### Description: 
Linear search scans each element of the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.

### Algorithm:
1.Start from the first element.

2.Compare the target element with the current element.

3.If it matches, return the current element.

4.If it does not match, move to the next element.

5.Repeat until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.

### Time Complexity: O(n)
1.Best case: O(1) (if the target is the first element)

2.Worst case: O(n) (if the target is the last element or not present)

## 2.Binary Search:

### Description: 
 Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Algorithm:
1.Start with the entire list.

2.Find the middle element.

3.If the target element is equal to the middle element, return the middle element.

4.If the target element is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half.

5.If the target element is greater than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half.

6.Repeat until the target element is found or the interval is empty.


### Time Complexity: O(log n)
1.Best case: O(1) (if the target is the middle element)

2.Worst case: O(log n) (logarithmic search through the list)



## Step 2: Setup

Create a class Book with attributes like bookId, title, and author.

## Step 3: Implementation

The detailed code files are present in the code repository.

## Step 4: Analysis

### Time Complexity Comparison:

#### 1.Linear Search:

1.Best Case: O(1) (if the target is the first element)

2.Average Case: O(n/2) â‰ˆ O(n)

3.Worst Case: O(n) (if the target is the last element or not present)

4.Use Case: Linear search is useful for small or unsorted datasets.

#### 2.Binary Search:
1.Best Case: O(1) (if the target is the middle element)

2.Average Case: O(log n)

3.Worst Case: O(log n)

4.Use Case: Binary search is efficient for large, sorted datasets. It requires the list to be sorted.

### When to Use Each Algorithm:

#### 1.Linear Search:
1.Use for small datasets where the overhead of sorting is not justified.

2.Useful for unsorted datasets where sorting the data is not feasible or necessary.

3.Simple and requires no preprocessing.

#### 2.Binary Search:

1.Use for large datasets where fast search times are critical.

2.Requires the dataset to be sorted, which adds preprocessing time.

3.More efficient for frequent search operations on large, sorted datasets.

In a library management system, if the list of books is large and search operations are frequent, binary search would be more suitable after sorting the list. For smaller or unsorted lists, linear search would suffice due to its simplicity and lack of preprocessing requirements.
