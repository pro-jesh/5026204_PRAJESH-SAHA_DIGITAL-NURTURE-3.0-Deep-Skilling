## Step 1:  Understand Recursive Algorithms
### Concept of Recursion:

#### Description: 
 Recursion is a method of solving problems where a function calls itself as a subroutine. This allows the function to be repeatedly applied, breaking down complex problems into simpler ones.

#### Base Case: 
 The simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly without further recursion. It prevents infinite recursion.

 #### Recursive Case:
 The instance of the problem that reduces the problem into smaller sub-problems and calls the function recursively.
### Example of Recursion:
#### Factorial Calculation:
1.Factorial of n (n!) is n * (n-1)!.

2.Base case: 0! = 1.

3.Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!.

## Step 2: Setup

### Method to Calculate Future Value Using Recursive Approach:

To calculate the future value based on past growth rates, we can use a recursive function. Let's assume a simple scenario where the future value is predicted based on a constant annual growth rate.

### Formula:
#### Future Value=Present Value×(1+Growth Rate)^n
Where n is the number of years.

## Step 3: Implementation

The detailed code file is present in the code repository.

## Step 4: Analysis

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n) because it makes one recursive call for each year, leading to a linear time complexity relative to the number of years.

### Optimizing the Recursive Solution:

#### Memoization:
Store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. This technique can significantly reduce the time complexity by converting the recursion into dynamic programming.

#### Time Complexity with Memoization:

The time complexity of the memoized version is O(n) because each year's calculation is stored and retrieved in constant time, preventing redundant calculations.

#### Advantages of Memoization:
1.Efficiency: Reduces the number of calculations by storing and reusing previously computed results.

2.Performance: Significantly improves the performance for problems with overlapping subproblems.

In conclusion, recursion simplifies the implementation of certain problems, but it can lead to excessive computations. Using memoization optimizes recursive solutions, making them more efficient for practical applications such as financial forecasting.
