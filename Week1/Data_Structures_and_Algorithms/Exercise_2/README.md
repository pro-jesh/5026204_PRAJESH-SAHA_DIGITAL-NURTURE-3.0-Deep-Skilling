## Step 1:  Understand Asymptotic Notation
## Big O Notation:

Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It provides an upper bound on the time or space complexity, helping us understand the worst-case scenario for an algorithm. It abstracts away constants and lower-order terms, focusing on how the runtime or space requirements grow with the input size.

## Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:
### 1.Best-Case Scenario: 
1.The scenario where the algorithm performs the fewest possible steps.
2.For a search algorithm, the best case is finding the target element at the first position.
### 2.Average-Case Scenario: 
1.The scenario that gives a sense of the expected behavior of the algorithm over all possible inputs.
2.For a search algorithm, it involves considering the average number of steps required to find the target element.
### Worst-Case Scenario: 
1.The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum possible steps.
2.For a search algorithm, the worst case is when the target element is not found or is at the last position in the list.

## Step 2: Setup

Define a Product class with attributes such as productId, productName and category.

## Step 3: Implementation

The detailed code files are present in the code repository.

## Step 4: Analysis

### Time Complexity Analysis:

#### 1.Linear Search:
1.Best Case: O(1) (target found at the first position)
2.Average Case: O(n) (target found somewhere in the middle)
3.Worst Case: O(n) (target not found or found at the last position)
#### 2.Binary Search:
1.Best Case: O(1) (target found at the middle position)
2.Average Case: O(log n) (target found after several divisions)
3.Worst Case: O(log n) (target not found or found after several divisions).

### Algorithm Suitability:

Binary search is more suitable for the e-commerce platform due to its logarithmic time complexity, making it much faster for large datasets compared to linear search. However, binary search requires the array to be sorted, which means an additional sorting step if the array is not already sorted. If the dataset is frequently updated, the sorting overhead needs to be considered.

For static or rarely updated datasets, binary search is optimal. For frequently updated datasets where maintaining a sorted array is costly, a balanced binary search tree or other data structures like hash tables might be more suitable.
