## Step 1:  Understand Array Representation
## Array Representation in Memory:

### Contiguous Memory Allocation: 
Arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory. Each element of the array is placed next to its neighboring elements.
### Indexing: 
Arrays use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0. The address of any element can be computed as: address = base_address + (index * element_size).
### Advantages: 
1.Constant-Time Access: Accessing any element by its index takes O(1) time.

2.Memory Efficiency: Arrays use a fixed amount of memory, which makes them memory efficient.

3.Simplicity: Arrays are straightforward to implement and use.

## Step 2: Setup

Create a class Employee with attributes like employeeId, name, position, and salary.

## Step 3: Implementation

The detailed code files are present in the code repository.

## Step 4: Analysis

### Time Complexity:

#### 1.Add Employee:

1.Time Complexity: O(1)

2.Adding an employee to the array is constant time, assuming the array is not full.

#### 2.Search Employee:

1.Time Complexity: O(n)

2.Searching for an employee requires a linear scan of the array, so the time complexity is linear.

#### 3.Traverse Employees:
1.Time Complexity: O(n)

2.Traversing the array and displaying each employee takes linear time.

#### 4.Delete Employee:

1.Time Complexity: O(n)

2.Deleting an employee involves finding the employee (O(n)) and then shifting elements (O(n)), resulting in linear time complexity.


### Limitations of Arrays:
1.Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, so the capacity must be known in advance or require resizing, which is costly.

2.Inefficient Deletions: Deleting an element requires shifting all subsequent elements, which can be slow.

3.Linear Search: Searching in an unsorted array is linear in time complexity.

4.Memory Usage: Allocating a large array may waste memory if the array is not fully utilized.

### When to Use Arrays:
1.Static Data: When the size of the data is known and does not change frequently.

2.Fast Access: When fast random access is required, as arrays provide O(1) access time.

3.Memory Efficiency: When the overhead of additional data structures is not justified.

For dynamic data where the size can change frequently, data structures like ArrayList (which dynamically resizes) or LinkedList (which allows efficient insertions and deletions) might be more suitable.
