# Inventory Management System

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem
## Why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories:

Data structures and algorithms are crucial for handling large inventories because they provide efficient ways to store, manage, and retrieve data. A well-chosen data structure allows quick access to inventory items, efficient updates, and minimal storage overhead. Efficient algorithms ensure that operations such as adding, updating, and deleting inventory items are performed in a timely manner, which is critical for maintaining real-time inventory accuracy and enabling swift decision-making.

## Types of data structures suitable for this problem:
### 1.ArrayList: 
Suitable for maintaining an ordered list of products where frequent access and iteration are required.
### 2.HashMap: 
Suitable for quickly accessing, adding, and updating products using unique product IDs.
### 3.LinkedList: 
Suitable for scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are required.

Given the need for quick access and updates by product ID, a HashMap is a suitable choice for this problem.

## Step 2: Setup

1.Create a new Java project for the inventory management system.
2.Define a Product class with attributes such as productId, productName, quantity, and price.

## Step 3: Implementation

The detailed code files are present in the code repository.

## Step 4: Analysis

### Time Complexity Analysis:

#### 1.Add Product:
Insertion in a HashMap takes O(1) average time complexity.
#### 2.Update Product:
Updating an entry in a HashMap also takes O(1) average time complexity.
#### 3.Delete Product:
Deletion of an entry in a HashMap takes O(1) average time complexity.

### Optimization Discussion:

Given that the HashMap provides O(1) average time complexity for add, update, and delete operations, it is already optimized for these operations. Further optimizations could involve improving the load factor and initial capacity of the HashMap to balance space and time efficiency, depending on the expected number of products in the inventory.
